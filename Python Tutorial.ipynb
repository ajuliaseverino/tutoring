    "The main thing to note: I *don't* expect to be well-calibrated on the difficulty of the exercises. I learned to program almost 10 years ago: I am not going to be good at assessing the difficulty of exercises for beginners. If you're having trouble with an exercise this is *my* fault and you shouldn't get disheartened."

    "### Why Classes and Objects?\n",
    "[Back to top](#objects-and-classes-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually quite a few reasons to uses classes. They sort of sit at the intersection of a bunch of different design goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Modeling Data\n",
    "First and foremost: classes/objects are a pretty natural way to model data. Usually we *don't* want to store a raw list of numbers or a bunch of strings without any context. In practice we're trying to store data with *named* attributes: users have name, passwords, emails, and settings. Items for sale have a name, images, a description, a price, maybe a list of vendors. An online portfolio has a list of pieces, each of which might have a name, a date, and of course an image of the artwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take that last example. We have three pieces of data: name (a string), date (a string), and image (some raw image data). We *could* just store that as a list `[name, date, image]`. But that's actually pretty opaque. If you see that data without context you might not know exactly what it's supposed to be. Organizing things in classes makes it clear exactly what something is and what we're supposed to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Methods Are Simpler\n",
    "Imagine we *did* just pass around a tuple of data. Let's take the `Employee` example from before. Now an Employee is just a list `[name, id, salary, department]`. How do we write something like the `give_raise` method? We have to do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    employee = [name, id, salary, department]\n",
    "    def give_raise(employee_list, amount):\n",
    "        new_salary = employee_list[2] + amount\n",
    "        employee_list[2] = new_salary\n",
    "        return employee_list\n",
    "        \n",
    "    employee = give_raise(employee, 5000)\n",
    "    \n",
    "That's... pretty messy. It gets *much worse* when you have 1000 lines of this, because it's not *nearly* as clear what individual functions or tuples actually are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Inheritance Is Nice\n",
    "Continuing with the previous example: how the fuck are we going to handle having multiple kinds of employees? Let's say we have both salaried and hourly employees. The way we calculate their weekly pay is totally different: one requires us to calculate all their hours and multiply that by their rate and the other requires dividing a salary by 52. So, okay, we write one function for each type of employee. But now we have to directly keep track of what kind of employee each piece of data is! We'd have to do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    hourly_1 = [\"John\", 0, 15, \"retail\", \"hourly\"]\n",
    "    hourly_2 = [\"Joan\", 1, 16, \"retail\", \"hourly\"]\n",
    "    salary_1 = [\"Dave\", 2, 50000, \"customer service\", \"salaried\"]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    all_employess = [hourly_1, hourly_2, salary_1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for emp in employees:\n",
    "        if emp[4] == \"hourly\":\n",
    "            # call the function to calculate checks for hourly employees\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # call the function to calculate checks for salaried employees\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative with methods and inheritance is just:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for emp in employees:\n",
    "        emp.calculate_check()\n"

    "1. Python creates a *blank* `Student` object with no attributes.\n",
