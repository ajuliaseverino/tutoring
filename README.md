## Project Ideas

### Video/Sound Randomizer Thing
Take video and sound streams, mix them, combine some set of videos together into one larger video

Longer term, run this as a website

### Website for Felix

### Keyboard
Tap keys, play music

### Auto generate blues music
Could do lyrics, multiple instruments, etc. Could maybe generate sheet music too

### Graphics primitives stuff
e.g. playing around with OpenCV or OpenGL
